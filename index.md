<br>
"The Nightlife Rescue Plan That Could Save Your City’s Scene" - City Lab<br>
<br>
I'm an editor of The Global Nighttime Recovery Plan - a collaborative, practical guide for cities that are trying to determine the best way to design and execute a safe and feasible strategy to reopen and reactivate their creative and night-time economies.<br>
<br>
The guide is a joint effort that involves activists, practitioners, academics and industry representatives from all over the world, and is meant to be an interactive platform to share frameworks, tools, and practices among cities during these unprecedented times. For this reason, the guide is meant to be both an accurate but flexible document that can be updated as the circumstances change. <br>
<br>
Partners on this project include Vibe Lab, PennPraxis, Fraunhofer Institute and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.

[Creative Footprint - NYC / Tokyo / Berlin](https://www.creative-footprint.org/)
<br>
<br>Client - Vibe Lab
<br>
The Creative Footprint (CFP) is a sociocultural initiative that maps and indexes creative space to measure the impact of nightlife and cultural activity on cities.<br>
<br>
I developed a geo-spatial methodology to get deep insights about how creative spaces are related to economic and demographic indicators and how they are affected by land use policies and transportation networks.<br>

[24HrPHL](http://24HrPHL.org/)
<br>
<br>
24HrPHL is a resource and community engagement group in Philadelphia's nightlife arts and culture community. I founded this group in 2017, and it has created programs and resources including sexual harrassment identification and de-escalation training for venues, survey research and policy engagement, venue opening guides, harm reduction toolkits, directories of COVID-related resources, and more.<br><br>

## Urban Planning - Data Analytics and Software Design
<br>
TEXT - overview of practice area
<br><br>
[Center for Safe Mobility Eye Tracking](http://www.safemobility.org/)
<br><br>
I am the lead Data Scientist on the Center for Safe Mobility’s research team. The research group is deploying a wearable sensor technology called Tobii to understand how the built environment affects walkers, cyclists, and more. I've built custom software in R to analyze the sensor data—which measures dozens of bio-metric indicators in 10 millisecond increments—and relate user stress in response to the features of the built environment.<br>

<br><br>
[Communication Neuroscience Lab - Geoscanning Research Group](https://cn.asc.upenn.edu/)
<br><br>
I provide geospatial data analysis, software development, and urban planning expertise to a research group examining the relationship between environmental risk factors, observed behavior, and brain activity. Using a wide variety of data sources, including tobacco retailer data, census information, GPS data and CT scans, this project integrates medical, behavioral and public health data using a geographic lens. <br>

### Historic Preservation
[Sacred Places, Civic Spaces (2019)](https://www.design.upenn.edu/pennpraxis/work/infill-philadelphia-sacred-places-civic-spaces-program-evaluation)
<br><br>
Conducted a survey-based evaluation process for the Infill Philadelphia: Sacred Places / Civic Spaces project, a partnership between the Community Design Collaborative and Partners for Sacred Places, with North 4th LLC as project managers. The two-year project seeks to re-envision underutilized, purpose-built religious properties in Philadelphia as community hubs, adding the design and development community’s voice to a growing dialogue about the intersection between historic sacred places and communities.<br>
