## Nighttime Arts and Culture
[Global Nighttime Recovery Plan](http://nighttime.org/recoveryplan)
<br>
"The Nightlife Rescue Plan That Could Save Your City’s Scene" - City Lab<br>
<br>
I'm an editor of The Global Nighttime Recovery Plan - a collaborative, practical guide for cities that are trying to determine the best way to design and execute a safe and feasible strategy to reopen and reactivate their creative and night-time economies. The guide is a joint effort that involves activists, practitioners, academics and industry representatives from all over the world<br>
<br>
Partners on this project include Vibe Lab, PennPraxis, Fraunhofer Institute and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.

[Creative Footprint - NYC / Tokyo / Berlin](https://www.creative-footprint.org/)
<br>
<br>Client - Vibe Lab
<br>
The Creative Footprint (CFP) is a sociocultural initiative that maps and indexes creative space to measure the impact of nightlife and cultural activity on cities.<br>
<br>
I developed a geo-spatial methodology to get deep insights about how creative spaces are related to economic and demographic indicators and how they are affected by land use policies and transportation networks.<br>

[24HrPHL](http://24HrPHL.org/)
<br>
<br>
24HrPHL is a resource and community engagement group in Philadelphia's nightlife arts and culture community. I was a founding member of this group in 2017. We have created programs and resources including sexual harrassment identification and de-escalation training for venues, survey research and policy engagement, venue opening guides, harm reduction toolkits, directories of COVID-related resources, and more.<br><br>

## Urban Planning - Data Analytics and Software Design
[Center for Safe Mobility Eye Tracking](http://www.safemobility.org/)
<br><br>
I am the lead Data Scientist on the Center for Safe Mobility’s research team. The research group is deploying a wearable sensor technology called Tobii to understand how the built environment affects walkers, cyclists, and more. I've built custom software in R to analyze the sensor data—which measures dozens of bio-metric indicators in 10 millisecond increments—and relate user stress in response to the features of the built environment.<br>

<br><br>
[Communication Neuroscience Lab - Geoscanning Research Group](https://cn.asc.upenn.edu/)
<br><br>
I provide geospatial data analysis, software development, and urban planning expertise to a research group examining the relationship between environmental risk factors, observed behavior, and brain activity. Using a wide variety of data sources, including tobacco retailer data, census information, GPS data and CT scans, this project integrates medical, behavioral and public health data using a geographic lens. <br>

## Urban Planning Program Evaluation 
### Parks and Open Space
[Reimagining The Civic Commons (2016-17)](https://www.design.upenn.edu/pennpraxis/work/fairmount-park-conservancy-reimagining-civic-commons)
<br><br>
PennPraxis worked with the Fairmount Park Conservancy (FPC) in conjunction with the Philadelphia pilot of the Reimagining the Civic Commons initiative, funded by the Knight Foundation, William Penn Foundation, and JPB Foundation.  The initiative united partners from five key civic assets in Philadelphia—Bartram’s Mile, Discovery Center, The Viaduct Rail Park, Lovett Library and Park, and Centennial Commons—that were undergoing phased redesigns beginning in the summer of 2016.  PennPraxis assisted in the design and implementation of data collection and baseline monitoring to document the impacts of the initial phases of implementation. PennPraxis deployed a team to collect this information using site observation, intercept surveys, and user counts to create bases of data to measure future impacts.

<br><br>
[OvalPHL / The Oval Program Evaluation (2017-18)](https://www.design.upenn.edu/pennpraxis/work/ben-franklin-parkway-oval)
<br><br>
PennPraxis developed software for documenting site usage and mapping spatial data for a variety of sites and questions. In 2017 and 2018, PORT Architecture + Urbanism designed temporary pop-up public space installations at Eakins Oval, and hired PennPraxis to collect data on visitors for the Fairmount Park Conservancy. <br><br>

### Transportation
[An Evaluation of Pittsburgh's Dynamically Priced Curb Parking Pilot (2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309231344_An_Evaluation_of_Pittsburgh%27s_Dynamically-Priced_Curb_Parking_Pilot)
<br><br>
An econometric analysis of one of the first dynamic, demand-based curb parking programs in the US. Uses custom occupancy estimations algorithms to create elasticity estimations and estimates price effects using regression discontinuity quasi-experimental models.<br><br>

### Historic Preservation
[Sacred Places, Civic Spaces (2019)](https://www.design.upenn.edu/pennpraxis/work/infill-philadelphia-sacred-places-civic-spaces-program-evaluation)
<br><br>
Conducted a survey-based evaluation process for the Infill Philadelphia: Sacred Places / Civic Spaces project, a partnership between the Community Design Collaborative and Partners for Sacred Places, with North 4th LLC as project managers. The two-year project seeks to re-envision underutilized, purpose-built religious properties in Philadelphia as community hubs, adding the design and development community’s voice to a growing dialogue about the intersection between historic sacred places and communities.<br>
